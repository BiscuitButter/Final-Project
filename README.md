# Final-Project

## BACKGROUND 

The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) county-to-county migration data are an incredible resource for understanding migration in the United States. 
Data for the United States are based on year-to-year address changes reported on individual income tax returns filed with the IRS. They present migration patterns by State or by county for the entire United States and are available for inflows—the number of new residents who moved to a State or county and where they migrated from, and outflows—the number of residents leaving a State or county and where they went.

Produced annually since 1991 in conjunction with the US Census Bureau, making the IRS migration data one of the largest sources of migration data. 

## HYPOTHESIS

The hypothesis is that there is a correlation between the Cost of Living Index and migration flow

## EXPERIMENTAL PLAN
By using different sources (see below), we will try to collect and clean up raw data from the past 5 years from the IRS website. 
The data will then be analyzed with different statistical methods in order to understand the relationship between migration flows, age, wages and taxes.

Here a schematic rapresentation of our work flow.

## Results

In our fist analysis we cleaned the data from inflow/outflow for the 2017/2018.
We devided the analysis in "flow" that allowed us to understand the migration flow from on county to another, or from one state to another during the year 2017-2018.

Moreover we add another table, called "total" that allowed us have a geneal view ofthe total migration flow in USA.
