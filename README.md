#Final-Project

## BACKGROUND 

The Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) county-to-county migration data are an incredible resource for understanding migration in the United States. Produced annually since 1990 in conjunction with the US Census Bureau, the IRS migration data represent 95 to 98 percent of the tax filing universe and their dependents, making the IRS migration data one of the largest sources of migration data. However, any analysis using the IRS migration data must process at least seven legacy formats of these public data across more than 2000 data files -- a serious burden for migration scholars.

## HYPOTHESIS
The hypothesis is that there is a correlation between the Cost of Living Index and migration flow

## EXPERIMENTAL PLAN
By using different sources (see below), we will try to collect and clean up raw data from the past 5 years from the IRS website. 
The data will then be analyzed with different statistical methods in order to understand the relationship between migration flows, age, wages and taxes.

Here a schematic rapresentation of our work flow.
